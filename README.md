# Project "Mesto"
https://annabreamer.github.io/mesto-project/
## Overview
This project is an interactive photo-sharing service built with JavaScript. I implemented dynamic card creation and deletion, modal windows for profile editing, card addition, and photo preview, as well as like actions on cards. I further enhanced the project by integrating comprehensive form validation and connecting the interface to an external API for user and card data. The code is modularized using ES6 modules and bundled with Webpack, ensuring a maintainable and responsive application.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5, CSS3** (responsive design)**, JavaScript** (ES6 modules, Webpack, Babel)**, Git, Figma**
